# Bing Bot
This is a simple bot which searches Bing. It is not intended to collect reward points, so don't do that. 

The bot uses Selenium Webdriver. To install it use:

```
pip install selenium
```

or

```
python -m pip install selenium
```

depending on how you have your system setup.

To check that Selenium has successfully installed, you can type:

```
>>>import selenium
```

and if you get no errors, it works.
